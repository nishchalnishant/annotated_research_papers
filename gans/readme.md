- Inf;uences by --
-   imagine how a scene might look loke if we were to translate it from one set to another.
-   problem can be more broadly described as imageto-image translation [22], converting an image from one
    representation of a given scene, x, to another, y, e.g., grayscale to color, image to semantic labels, 
edge-map to photograph.   
- 
- Goal 
-   learn the mapping between an input image an an output image such that distribution of images is 
-   indistinguishable from the original using adversial loss.

-   in simple words seek an algorithm that can learn to translate between domains without paired input output examples 

- Training 
-   using aligned image set as paired training data is not available
